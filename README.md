# prostitute-background

Hello my fellow yees and haws!

My name is Nerd Fairchild. I'm a very new to this whole coding thing but I'm trying.
Also English is my second language so please let me know if you find any grammar mistakes I made so I can fix them. 

I made this Prostitute background to Dungeons & Dragons 5e because my character was a prostitute before he became an adventurer and I thought it would be cool to share this background with others.
Not every idea in this background is my own. I was highly inspired by a reddit user's (called MasterofIntrigue) prostitute background for 5e.
You can find MasterofIntrigue's reddit post about this background here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/8g6jjw/prostitute_5th_edition_background_sexually/

The two versions have a lot of things in common but there are a bunch of changes in my version which makes the background more useful and enjoyable for me.

I hope you'll like it and please let me know if you find any bugs or something else, so I can fix it.
